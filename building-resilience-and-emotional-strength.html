            <h3>Three Essential Coping Mechanisms</h3>

            <div class="strategies-grid">
                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h4>Mindfulness Practices</h4>
                    <p>Techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and present-moment awareness can bring calmness and help center your emotions during turbulent times.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h4>Physical Exercise</h4>
                    <p>Engaging in regular physical activity releases endorphins, reduces stress hormones, and provides a healthy outlet for processing emotions.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h4>Journaling</h4>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Additional Coping Strategies</h3>

            <h2>5. Embrace Self-Love and Compassion</h2>

            <p>Embracing <strong>self-love</strong> is pivotal for cultivating the resilience necessary to endure life's challenges. Practicing <strong>self-care</strong> and <strong>self-compassion</strong> nurtures inner strength, enabling you to face ups and downs with confidence and grace.</p>

            <p>Self-love involves treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a dear friend. It means acknowledging your imperfections without harsh judgment and celebrating your strengths and progress along the way.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Self-Compassion Practice</h4>
                <p>When facing a difficult situation, ask yourself: "What would I say to a good friend going through this same challenge?" Then offer yourself those same words of comfort, encouragement, and support. This practice helps build emotional resilience and inner strength.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Building Self-Love Through Daily Practices</h3>
