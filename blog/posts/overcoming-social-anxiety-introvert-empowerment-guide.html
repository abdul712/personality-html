                <section id="introduction">
                    <p><strong>Overcoming social anxiety</strong> as an introvert requires understanding a crucial distinction: introversion is not the same as social anxiety, though they often intersect in ways that can create unique challenges. While introverts naturally recharge through solitude and prefer deeper, more meaningful interactions, social anxiety stems from an excessive fear of judgment or rejection in social situations.</p>
                    
                    <p>This comprehensive guide will help you navigate the intersection of introversion and social anxiety, providing evidence-based strategies to build confidence, enhance your social skills, and create the supportive networks you need to thrive. You'll learn to embrace your introverted strengths while developing tools to manage anxiety and engage more comfortably in social situations.</p>

                    <div class="key-insight">
                        <h4>🎯 Essential Understanding</h4>
                        <p>Social anxiety can affect both introverts and extroverts, but introverts may face unique challenges because their natural preference for solitude can be misunderstood as avoidance or antisocial behavior. The key is learning to distinguish between healthy introversion and limiting anxiety.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Whether you're dealing with mild social discomfort or more significant anxiety, this guide offers practical, actionable strategies that honor your introverted nature while empowering you to engage more confidently with the world around you.</p>
