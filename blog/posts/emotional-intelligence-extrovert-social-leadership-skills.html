            <p>Whether in sales, leadership, community building, or creative collaboration, extroverts bring energy, enthusiasm, and social intelligence that benefits everyone around them. By recognizing and celebrating these strengths while continuing to develop emotional awareness and inclusivity, extroverts can create positive change and meaningful connections that last a lifetime.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                "The greatest extrovert leaders are not those who talk the most, but those who create the most space for others to shine. Their true strength lies not in being the center of attention, but in helping others find their voice and discover their own power to connect and contribute."
