                            <p class="lead">Emotional intelligence is a hallmark of psychological development that profoundly impacts every aspect of our lives. It manifests through a series of behaviors and attitudes that reflect a deep understanding of oneself and others, from regulating emotions to displaying empathy and compassion.</p>
                            
                            <p>The ability to <strong>understand and manage emotions effectively</strong> has become increasingly recognized as a critical factor in personal success, relationship quality, and overall well-being. Unlike traditional intelligence (IQ), emotional intelligence (EQ) can be developed and improved throughout life, making it one of the most valuable skills you can cultivate.</p>
