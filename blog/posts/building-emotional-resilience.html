                            <p class="lead">Emotional resilience is the ability to <strong>adapt, recover, and even thrive</strong> in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or significant sources of stress. It's not about avoiding challenges or never feeling overwhelmed—it's about developing the inner resources and skills to bounce back stronger from life's inevitable difficulties.</p>
                            
                            <p>Building resilience is like developing emotional muscle—it requires practice, patience, and consistent effort. The good news is that resilience is not a trait you're born with or without; it's a set of learnable skills and attitudes that can be developed throughout your life. Every challenge you face is an opportunity to strengthen your resilience and expand your capacity for growth.</p>
