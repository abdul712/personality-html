            <h2>🧭 Defining MBTI: A Foundation for Understanding</h2>

            <div class="mbti-overview">
                <h3>🎯 What is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator?</h3>
                <p>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a psychological evaluation tool designed to classify individuals into one of <strong>16 distinct personality types</strong>. It utilizes a framework developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers, drawing upon Carl Jung's theory of psychological types.</p>
                
                <p>By evaluating preferences on four dichotomous scales, the MBTI offers insights into one's personality, highlighting strengths, preferences, and potential areas for growth. This tool is not just a reflection of how one sees the world but also how one interacts within it.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The MBTI is <span class="highlight">invaluable for personal development</span>, team building, and enhancing interpersonal relationships.

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>🎭 Core Introverted Characteristics</h3>
                <ul>

                <h3>🚫 Debunking Introvert Myths</h3>
                <p>Despite common beliefs, introverted personality types are often mischaracterized as shy or distant, when in reality, they exhibit a depth of observation and reflection. These misunderstood individuals prioritize authenticity and seek deep connections, favoring meaningful conversations over superficial small talk.</p>
                
                <p>Unlike the misconception that they are aloof, introverts, including types like INFP and INFJ, can be highly organized, decisive, and intuitive. Their reflective nature doesn't imply a lack of sociability but rather a preference for engaging in discussions that resonate on a personal level.</p>

            <h2>🧠 Understanding Cognitive Functions</h2>

            <p>Building on the understanding of personality types, it is important to examine the role of <span class="highlight">cognitive functions</span> in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which include Sensing, Intuition, Thinking, and Feeling.

            <h3>Function Hierarchy in Introverts</h3>

            <p>Each personality type has a <span class="highlight">dominant function</span> that plays a leading role in their actions and decisions, supported by an auxiliary function that aids in balance and depth. The tertiary function offers additional, though less developed, perspectives, while the inferior function might represent a potential blind spot or area for growth.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>🏗️ Function Stack Structure</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Auxiliary Function:</strong> Supporting function that provides balance (extroverted for introverts)</li>
                    <li><strong>Tertiary Function:</strong> Develops in midlife, opposite attitude of auxiliary</li>
                    <li><strong>Inferior Function:</strong> Least developed, source of stress but also growth potential</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Understanding these cognitive functions can illuminate individual strengths and areas for improvement, enhancing decision-making processes and personal development. For introverts, the dominant function is always introverted, meaning their primary way of processing information happens internally.</p>
