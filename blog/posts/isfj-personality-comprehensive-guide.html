            <p>With a <span class="highlight">keen ability to listen empathetically</span> and pay close attention to details, ISFJs value stability in all forms of relationships and work settings. Their loyalty, reliability, and unwavering commitment to their responsibilities are hallmark traits that make them trusted and valued individuals.</p>

            <h2>⚠️ Potential Weaknesses: Areas for Growth</h2>

            <p>While ISFJs are known for their strengths in empathy and practical assistance, they also face several challenges that can hinder their wellbeing and performance. Understanding these potential weaknesses is crucial for personal development and self-awareness.</p>

            <h3>Sensitivity to Criticism</h3>
            <p>Their high sensitivity means they may <span class="highlight">take criticism too personally</span>, often feeling wounded by feedback that was intended to be constructive. This trait, coupled with their loyalty and altruism, makes them prone to overworking, as they put others' needs before their own, sometimes to their detriment.</p>

            <h3>Difficulty with Change</h3>
            <p>ISFJs' <span class="highlight">preference for stability</span> makes adaptability to sudden changes a significant challenge. Their somewhat inflexible nature can complicate their ability to embrace new situations, potentially limiting their personal and professional growth.</p>
